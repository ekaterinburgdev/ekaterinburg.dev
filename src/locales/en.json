    "Details": "<summary>Details for the most curious</summary> <p> Today, the city is not just a place to live, but a huge system of services, functions, events, scenarios, interactions. Only all this is not connected with each other in any way now. Culture here, medicine there, transport here, study here, power generally on the sidelines, etc. And it all looks different (and always bad), and it's difficult to work with it, and it's impossible to find anything. </p> <p> Therefore, we plan to create a full-fledged digital ecosystem of Yekaterinburg. First, we will collect in one place everything that is now scattered across an endless list of sites. There must be exactly one entry point to communicate with the city. Find out about the events, make an appointment with a therapist, get in line at kindergarten, get benefits, write an application for repairs in the house, file a complaint, download the Ecb logo, coordinate the placement of signage, support local communities, anonymously hand over a dealer, vote on an 'active citizen', automatically make a tax deduction, resolve issues with the management company and so on — all in one convenient and beautiful place. </p> <p> As information about residents accumulates, we will automate their lives. If the system knows the entire medical record, shopping in stores, registration, social payments, benefits, trips, my car, insurance, etc., it will be able to give useful suggestions: </p> <ul> <li> It's time to go to the doctor or undergo a medical examination, do you have a free Tuesday morning, let me write it down? </li> <li> Your travel card is running out, let's fill it up for a month, with your regime you will save 150₽ </li> <li> In a week there will be a fest where your favorite performer Shysha will perform, buy a ticket? </li> <li> Congratulations on the birth of a child! Let's immediately get in line at the kindergarten </li> <li> It's time to make a booster from Covid, let's go to the bar on Friday, and on Saturday evening for a vaccination? </li> <li> Over the past year, you have accumulated 32,234 ₽ tax deductions for medicine, work and mortgage. We have already arranged everything, tell me, which card to transfer money to? </li> </ul> <p> Let the machine do everything for us, we are not obliged to keep so many worries in our heads. </p>",
    "Description": "<p>This is more than mos.ru in Moscow. This is not an analogue of public services.</p> <p> Why is this happening in Yekaterinburg? Because this is a city of enthusiasts. We are burning with our business. We unite to move mountains, and we don't compete for profit. We are a community, not a business. </p><p> Therefore, only we and only here can do the impossible. And for this we need you: specialists in backend, frontend, c#, python, figure, product and interface design, testers, analysts, managers, managers, producers. </p><p> Our team already has cool guys from Contour, Yandex, Dot. And we are waiting for all professionals who are ready to create a city of the future. </p> <p> What to do? There are two options here: <a href='https://t.me/nibach ' target='_blank'> write to us in the cart </a> and chat, or take a look <a href='https://github.com/ekaterinburgdev /' target='_blank'> on github </a> andjust start solving puzzles right away. </p> <p> Our locomotive is already rushing at full speed. Fly in while you can. </p>"
